    <h2>Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen</h2>
    <img src="Images/CongregationLeavingtheReformedChurchinNuenen.jpg" alt="Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen">
    <p>Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen was painted with oil on canvas by Vincent van Gogh in January - Feburary 1884 while he was living in Nuenen, Netherlands.
        This somber painting depicts churchgoers exiting the village church where Van Gogh’s father was a pastor. Originally created as a gift for his mother, 
        the work was later altered,  with Van Gogh adding figures dressed in mourning attire after his father’s death in Autumn 885.
