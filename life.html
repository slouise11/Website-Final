            <h3>Younger Years</h3>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, a small town in the Netherlands. His father was a pastor, and he had a younger brother named Theo, 
                who later became his biggest supporter. In 1869, Vincent got his first job at an art dealership in The Hague, 
                where he worked with paintings and traveled to London and Paris. However, he didn’t enjoy the job and was let go in 1876. After that, 
                he worked briefly as a teacher in England and later became a preacher in Belgium. He lived among poor coal miners and tried to help them, 
                but his way of preaching was seen as too unusual, and he lost his position. These early experiences shaped how he saw the world and influenced his later paintings, 
                which often focused on everyday people and their struggles.</p>

            <h3>Adult Life</h3>
            <p>In 1880, at the age of 27, Van Gogh decided to become a painter. He moved around a lot, teaching himself how to draw and paint with financial support from his brother Theo.
                In 1886, he joined Theo in Paris, where he met famous artists like Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Camille Pissarro, and Paul Gauguin, who became his friends. 
                During this time, his painting style changed a lot as he was influenced by Impressionism. He also painted many self-portraits.
                In 1888, Van Gogh moved to Provence in southern France, where he painted some of his most famous works, including Sunflowers. Hoping to create an artist's community, 
                he invited Gauguin to join him. However, it is alleged they had a major argument, and in a fit of distress, Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a razor blade. 
                Overcome with guilt afterward, he ended up cutting off part of his own ear, marking the beginning of his struggles with mental illness.
                After the ear incident in late 1888, Van Gogh’s mental health declined. He experienced severe breakdowns and was eventually admitted to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in 1889.
                During his time there, he painted some of his most famous works, including The Starry Night and Irises.</p>

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>After painting his last painting 'Wheatfield with Crows', On July 27, 1890, it is believed that Van Gogh, suffering from depression, shot himself in the chest. He survived for two days but died on July 29, with his brother Theo by his side. His last words were reportedly,
             "The sadness will last forever." While his death is widely considered a suicide, some theories suggest he may have been accidentally shot by local boys. 
             Regardless of the exact cause, his passing marked the end of a troubled yet extraordinary life, and he left behind a vast collection of paintings that would later make him one of the most celebrated artists in history.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Although Van Gogh was not famous during his lifetime and sold only one painting, his work became widely recognised after his death, largely thanks to Theo’s wife, 
            Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, who promoted his art. Today, he is considered one of the greatest artists in history, known for his expressive brushwork and emotional depth. His art is in museums
            all over the world with the main one being The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. </p>
