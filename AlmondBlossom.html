    <h2>Almond Blossoms</h2>
    <img src="Images/AlmondBlossom.jpg" alt="Almond Blossoms">
    <p>'Almond Blossoms' is a painting created by Vincent van Gogh with oil on canvas in Feburary 1890 while he was in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence. 
        Painted as a gift for his newborn nephew who was named after him, the artwork symbolizes hope and new beginnings and is the work that was held close to his family.
        Blossoms like these were one of Van Goghs favourite subjects, inspired by Japanese printmaking.
